Product Hunt _is_ a great place to launch a developer tool.

Many developer-first products successfully launched there. For inspiration, you can find stories and examples below.

This repository includes a wiki with bit-sized pro tips and discussions to help you prep your launch and enjoy it.

It also includes:
