So you want to contribute to this repo? Awesome!

I welcome every contribution. To do so, please [open a Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/fmerian/awesome-product-hunt/pulls).

I still do want to keep the quality of this repo, so I may not merge all PRs.

Relevant product launch examples:

- Product must be in the `Developer Tools` topic;
- Product must have at least one award, i.e. ranked in the Top 5 Products of the Day.

Some guidelines:

- Add one link per PR
  - Make sure the PR title is in the format: `Add {product}`
- Add the link:
```
| `YYYY-MM-DD` | [Name of the product ↗︎](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/{slug}) | #0 | #0 | #0 |
```
- Make sure the new submission isn't a duplicate
- Check the spelling and grammar
- Remove any trailing whitespace
- Sort the new submission by launch date

Thank you for making this repo more awesome! Enjoy!
