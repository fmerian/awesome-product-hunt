# additional notes

- You can still edit your post and change the launch date by adding `/edit` to the end of your URL.

On launch day:

- Add `/launch-day` to the end of your URL to get to a dashboard where you can monitor your entire launch from, respond to questions and comments about your product throughout the day.
- Share a link to your launch on social, email, and beyond. Don't explicitly ask for upvotes or spam with cold DMs and emails. Keep it genuine.
- Utilizing upvote services will result in your removal from the homepage. Sharing in promotion/upvote groups often results in low quality or spam activity that will negatively impact your launch performance. If your "growth consultant" is using prohibited tactics you will be held responsible.
