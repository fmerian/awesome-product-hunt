I've launched 42 dev tools on Product Hunt in the last 2 years — or maybe 55? To be honest, I've lost count.

I could bore you with the details of how Specify launched or that Product Hunt awarded me Community Member of the Year in 2022 (runner-up).

No. What you probably care about is what my key takeaways are.

So, here we go — what I learned from 42 (or 55) dev-first product launches on Product Hunt.

## Why Product Hunt

**Product Hunt definitely _is_ a great place to launch** — a place where many developer-first products launched successfully: Supabase, Resend, and Warp, to name a few.

According to [similarweb.com](https://www.similarweb.com/website/producthunt.com/#overview), it gets 4.8 million unique visitors every month, and according to [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/website-authority-checker/?input=producthunt.com), it has a 91 domain rating.

Product Hunt helps raise awareness, get feedback, and enable early traction.

Rishabh Kaul, Head of Marketing at Appsmith, who launched in March 2023 and ranked #5 Product of the Day, adds:

> **One of the often overlooked parts of Product Hunt is the reviews that you get during launch. They are customer testimonials for your marketing site.**
>
> — [Rishabh Kaul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhkaul), Head of Marketing, Appsmith

**The question isn't _if_ you should launch on Product Hunt. It's *how*.**

## Launching a developer tool on Product Hunt? Keep it simple

To start, some definitions:

- **Maker**: a user who works on the product
- **Hunter**: a user who submits a product and doesn't work on it
- **Upvoter**: a user who upvotes a product
- **Commenter**: a user who comments on a product
- **Launch page**: where your launched product lives
- **Kitty coins**: Novice (Level 0-100), Bronze (Level 101-500), Silver (Level 501-1,000), Gold (Level 1,001+)
- **Ranking**: Product of the Day / Week / Month / Year (i.e. Golden Kitty Award)

Let's be upfront. Over the years, I've contributed to launching many dev-first products and, is there a secret sauce? _No._

When Specify launched, we planned weeks ahead and launched on a weekday — we thought it would maximize exposure. We ranked #2 Product of the Day, #9 Product of the Week. We hit 2.5K unique visitors.

When Documenso launched, it was the opposite. We had no plan and launched during the weekend. We ranked #1 Product of the Day and #9 Product of the Week. We hit 2.5K unique visitors, too.

**Two different launches; same results.**

Take Peer Richelsen. Peer is the co-founder and co-CEO of Cal.com. He [launched 6 times on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/cal-com/awards) and got 10 awards. He puts it very simply:

> **Have a good product.**
>
> — Peer Richelsen, Co-founder and CEO, Cal.com

**You don't need to overthink to launch on Product Hunt successfully. Keep it simple.**

Despite what you can read here and there, there certainly isn't a formula to launch on Product Hunt. Still, there's a set of principles to help maximize your chances with your launch:

1. Polish your content and visual assets
2. Engage with the community
3. Launch at 12:01 AM PST and spread the word

## Setting up the launchpad

### Polishing the details

To start, below are the required inputs to submit a new product on Product Hunt. **You can find them [here](https://git.new/meow/kit) on GitHub to get started.**

- **Name of the product**: simply the name of your product in 40 characters or less
- **Tagline**: a concise and descriptive tagline in 60 characters max; avoid hyperbolic words and emojis — keep it simple
- **Description**: a short description of what the product does in less than 260 characters
- **Launch tags**: Up to three tags — [Browse full list here](https://www.producthunt.com/topics)
- **First comment**: tells the story, explains why you're building the product, and invites people to join the conversation
- **Thumbnail**: a 240 x 240 pixel thumbnail
- **Image gallery**: 2 to 8 images to show your product; avoid stock images and marketing fluff. Show the product, i.e. product screenshots. You can add social proof and a call-to-action to inspire action; The first image is used as the social preview when you share the link to your launch page.

**You can find the required inputs [here](https://git.new/meow/kit) on GitHub.**

Tanya Rai and her team launched LastMile AI in October 2023 and ranked #2 Product of the Day and #4 Product of the Week. In [this blog post](https://dev.to/tanyarai/1-developer-tool-of-the-month-1o41), Tanya shared some lessons learned, and I really enjoyed this quote on polishing the details:

> **We spent some time nailing the messaging in a way that was palatable to the Product Hunt community. It's good to tailor your messaging and media assets to the community — it will resonate more.**
>
> — [Tanya Rai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyarai/), Product Manager, LastMile AI

Now that you've polished the details and tailored the messaging and visual assets in a simple and straightforward way, it's time to schedule the launch and submit the product. I recommend finding a Hunter.

### Finding a Hunter

Do you need someone specific to submit your dev-first product on Product Hunt? By default, the answer is _no_. According to [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/launch/before-launch#hunters:-do-you-need-one), using a Hunter isn't a barrier to success:

- 79% of featured posts were by makers who self-hunted
- 60% of #1 Product of the Day winners were self-hunted

If finding a Hunter isn't a requirement _per se_, you may need one for three main reasons:

1. a Hunter reviews your inputs, gives feedback, and suggests improvements
2. on launch day, a Hunter can support by upvoting and replying to comments
3. a Hunter can leverage networks by promoting your launch on socials

**When done right, a Hunter is a catalyst for your launch.**

Take n8n, an open-source Zapier alternative. When the team launched its 1.0 in July 2023 (ranked #1 Product of the Day and #2 Product of the Week), it partnered with [Chris Messina](https://www.producthunt.com/@chrismessina), and Luis Guzmán, Head of Marketing, puts it very eloquently:

> **A recognized Hunter makes a difference. We partnered with Chris Messina to be our Hunter, and it helped a lot — even when Product Hunt says it doesn't.**
>
> — [Luis Guzmán](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guzmanluis/), Head of Marketing, n8n

Here's another example. When we launched Specify, we collaborated with [Hiten Shah](https://www.producthunt.com/@hnshah). We chose to partner with Hiten because he has an influence on Product Hunt and beyond. Above all, it was a fantastic feeling for the team, e.g. an extra source of motivation prior to the launch.

More personally, when I collaborate with teams to help them launch, like [Corbado](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/corbado) (launched in January 2024, ranked #4 Product of the Day) or [Jolt AI](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/usejolt-ai) (launch in January 2025, ranked #3 Product of the Day), I'm committed to challenging every aspect of the launch plan and supporting on launch days by leveraging my network. 

If anyone can submit a product on Product Hunt anytime, a Hunter certainly helps with the launch. 

### Warming up

In [this blog post](https://medium.com/@rrhoover/building-a-startup-build-an-audience-first-9fbba4f1fa15), Product Hunt's founder, Ryan Hoover, wrote:

> **Building a startup? Build an audience, first.**
>
> — Ryan Hoover, Founder, Product Hunt

**This could apply to product launches, too: if you're launching on Product Hunt, build an audience first.**

You can schedule your launch up to 30 days ahead. Below are some ideas to get started:

- Announce it in your Product Forum `/p/{yourProduct}` — see example from Bucket [here](https://meooow.link/bucket/soon)
- [Host an AMA session](https://www.producthunt.com/stories/how-to-host-a-successful-ama-on-product-hunt) — see examples from Bucket [here](https://meooow.link/bucket/ama) and Supabase [there](https://meooow.link/rorstro)
- Add your upcoming launch on [hunted.space](https://hunted.space) and [git.new/meow](https://git.new/meow/upcoming)
- Schedule as much content as possible: social posts, website banner, email campaigns
- Support other product launches

Also, make sure to tease your network and community early.

> **We let our network and product community know that we had planned to launch on Product Hunt. It was super valuable for us to have support from our existing users and network and they came through for us.**
>
> — [Tanya Rai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyarai/), Product Manager, LastMile AI

**Pro tip**: use a URL shortener like [Dub](https://mktto.dev/dub) as a backdoor edit button.

1. Create your short, memorable URL
2. Link it to your Product Hub, e.g. `/products/{yourProduct}`
3. Update it on launch day, e.g. `/products/{yourProduct}/launches/{slug}`

In [this file](https://git.new/meow/community), I suggest some ideas to leverage your community:

- List some key elements to play and mix
- Include links to posts and comments for inspiration

**Let's recap.**

So far, you have:

- polished the details: messaging and visual assets
- found a Hunter
- scheduled your launch
- scheduled as much content as possible
- started raising awareness, reaching out to your influencers, and engaging on Product Hunt

You're ready to go live.

## 24 hours on Product Hunt

Here's the day. **Launching on Product Hunt is a 24-hour race — and it starts at 12:01 AM PST.** 

For the first 4 hours of the day, Product Hunt hides upvotes and sorts the homepage randomly. According to [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/stories/let-s-talk-about-spam), this should give products "a more distributed chance at exposure early." Your objective is to rank in the Top 5 within that time to maximize exposure.

**Pro tip**: use [hunted.space](https://hunted.space) to monitor your launch day in real time.

```html
https://hunted.space/dashboard/{yourProduct}
```

During the day, upvote and reply to every comment. Make this day an opportunity to engage: start conversations and ask for feedback.

Laura Du Ry and the Appwrite team launched its Cloud Beta in October 2023 and ranked #4 Product of the Day. Laura tells:

> **The team was quick with responding and engaging. We cleared a part of the teams' calendar to be able to engage.**
>
> — [Laura Du Ry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-du-ry-53203b94/), Growth Manager, Appwrite

Tanya Rai from LastMile AI shares the feeling:

> **On launch day, we had the whole team on board to respond to messages almost instantly. This was a round-the-clock effort by the team to show that we were actively engaged and interested in what feedback we were receiving from the Product Hunt community. We left no questions or comments unanswered.**
>
> — [Tanya Rai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyarai/), Product Manager, LastMile AI

Make this launch day an opportunity to celebrate your efforts with your team and community. Make the most out of it by engaging in conversations and brainstorming new ideas, and above all, _enjoy it._

## Two more things

You just launched your developer tool on Product Hunt. Bravo!

There's two more things to keep the momentum going:
1. Maximize efforts
2. Keep launching

### Maximize efforts

With the assets you've worked on for your Product Hunt launch, you can maximize efforts by launching on more places, like [Hacker News](https://git.new/meow/hn) and [Dev Hunt](https://git.new/meow/dh), an open-source alternative for dev-first products.

### Keep launching

Launching on Product Hunt isn't a one-time opportunity. Launch early, launch often.

According to [Product Hunt](https://meooow.link/hc/repost), you have to "_wait at least six months in between posts for the same product or from the same company. Along with a six-month period, there also needs to be a significant update to the product._"

Product Hunt pays off in the long term, where the best teams keep launching.

Take Stripe. The company launched [69 times](https://www.producthunt.com/products/stripe/launches) on Product Hunt in the last 10 years. Supabase launched [16 times](https://www.producthunt.com/products/supabase/launches) in the last 4 years. Raycast has launched [15 products](https://www.producthunt.com/products/raycast/launches) since 2020.

**Launching multiple times creates a tailwind.** 
— [Repost this](https://twitter.com/fmerian/status/1676554020348100610)

Luis Guzmán, Head of Marketing at n8n (launched [5 times](https://www.producthunt.com/products/n8n-io/launches) since 2019), sums it up perfectly:

> **Every follower we collected from past launches receives a notification about recent launches. This helps get more exposure.**
>
> — [Luis Guzmán](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guzmanluis/), Head of Marketing, n8n

Launch, and keep launching.
