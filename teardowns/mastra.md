Mastra (YC W25) is launching on Product Hunt today, releasing stable 1.0 for building AI apps and agents, and announcing 300,000+ weekly npm downloads, 19,400+ GitHub stars, and production use at companies like Replit and WorkOS.

I had a blast working on this launch with the team, and wanted to share with you some thoughts we put into the ops.

It all started last December, when Alex reached out:

> We are launching 1.0 in January. Product Hunt came up and I thought of you.

Alex and I both worked at Clerk. Alex is a rare talent, and more importantly, nice and kind human. So, when I had the opportunity to collaborate with him again, this was a no brainer.

## Setting up the launchpad

Here's the reasoning we had when working on the required inputs. In one word: Consistency.

- **Product name**: Just `Mastra`. It's cleaner.
- **Product tagline**: The most important part? We kept it simple and reused the H1 from `mastra.ai` for consistency.
- **Product description**: You can add up to 500 characters. We made it shorter, in 237 characters, to let the CTA visible upfront.
- **Thumbnail**: Just the profile pic from X.
- **Image gallery**: Product Hunt recommends adding 3 or more images. We play-and-mixed with existing blocks from `mastra.ai` for consistency.
- **Launch tags**: up to 3 tags.

**Pro tip**: You can find the required inputs on GitHub.

## Additional thoughts

- **Launch timing**. A launch day on Product Hunt starts at 12:01 AM PST by default. We released 1.0 yesterday, and decided to launch on Product Hunt today to maximize exposure.
- **Distribution channels**. We focused effort on existing channels: X, LinkedIn, YouTube, Hacker News, and targeted communities - places where we already have an existing audience.
- **Link to the launch**. Last but not least, for this launch, the objective is to shine a spotlight on the open-source project and public repository so we decided to link the launch page to `github.com`, not `mastra.ai`.

## One more thing

Launching on Product Hunt is definitely not a one-time opportunity.

Awesome developer-first products like Supabase and Netlify have launched there multiple times (resp. 16 and 14 times). Product Hunt is about consistency.

## Wrapping up

That's it! Hope you find this thread helpful.
