Ultracite is an opinionated, zero-config code linter and formatter. [@haydenbleasel](https://github.com/haydenbleasel) launched it on Product Hunt twice this year, and I had a humble contribution as a Hunter.

**Different launches, different results. Here's what I learned.**

Ultracite first launched in June 2025, ranked `#6` Product of the Day. We launched it again 6 months later, reworked some inputs, and ranked `#2` Product of the Day.

## TL,DR: What we did differently

- **Made the tagline straight-to-the-point**
- **Told the story visually through the image gallery**
- **Picked a different launch day**

### Diff: Tagline

```diff
- Fast, automated code formatting for JavaScript apps
+ Opinionated, zero-config code linter and formatter
```

The most important part of a launch? [^1] First, we wanted a tagline that balances simplicity and accuracy. We refined the copy and went straight-to-the-point.

### Diff: Image gallery

On the first launch, the image gallery highlighted the key features. On the second launch, we told a different story, addressing the main objections upfront.

### Diff: Launch day

Last but not least, we opted for a different launch day.

Ultracite is (1) an open-source product (2) for developers, (3) built by a solo maker. In this context, we first decided to launch on a Sunday, less competitive than a week day according to Product Hunt. [^2] We ranked `#6` Product of the Day. On the second launch, we launched on another weekend. Result? `#2` Product of the Day.

## Recap: How to apply this to your launch

- **Keep your tagline simple, in plain English**
- **Tell your story visually through the image gallery**
- **Pick a launch day based on your context**

## Final thoughts: Product Hunt pays off in the long term

Launching multiple times on Product Hunt creates a tailwind. Each launch reaches more people, builds more followers, which then helps future launches. Ultracite first launched with 0 followers. Post-launch: 204 followers. [^3]

Product Hunt is about consistency. Launch, and keep launching.
