Appwrite last launched on Product Hunt [a month ago](https://www.producthunt.com/products/appwrite/launches/appwrite-sites). It was their fourth launch there, and they really nailed it:

- `#1` Product of the Day
- `#1` Developer Tool of the Week
- `#1` Developer Tool of the Month

## What Appwrite did right

1. **Polished the tagline and visual assets.** The most important part of this launch? The tagline is the first thing you read on the front page. "_The open-source Vercel alternative_" checks all the boxes: The community loves OSS products, and Vercel is in the [Top 0,1% most-loved products on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/shoutouts/all-time). The value is upfront.

2. **Found a Hunter.** Ben Lang was the hunter of this launch — an established user, among the [2022 Product Hunt Community Members of the Year](https://www.producthunt.com/golden-kitty-awards/hall-of-fame?year=2022#community-member-of-the-year) (runner-up). It helped increase reach and made a difference.

3. **Built momentum early.** The launch was planned for May 19, and the team first posted on 𝕏 [10 days before](https://x.com/appwrite/status/1920822067550711843).

4. **Engaged with the community.** The team upvoted and replied to every comment. An insider told me: "_The team was quick with responding and engaging. We cleared a part of the calendar to be able to engage._"

5. **Kept momentum going.** Last but not least, the team ran an ad campaign to stay top of mind until the end of the month.

## How to apply this to your launch

- **Keep the tagline simple and relatable**
- **Find a Hunter** — [may this thread help](https://www.producthunt.com/p/producthunt/hunters-who-are-visible-and-active-on-product-hunt-short-list)
- **Start building momentum early**
- **Launch, and keep launching** — it pays off in the long term

**Over to you! What are your key learnings from your previous product launches? What worked, what didn't work from your perspective?**
