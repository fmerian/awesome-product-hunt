Jolt AI launched on Product Hunt [last January](https://www.producthunt.com/products/jolt-ai/launches/jolt-ai-2) — among the [best developer tools launched in 2025](https://www.producthunt.com/p/general/best-developer-tools-launched-in-2025) in my opinion.

The product got featured, ranked `#3` Product of the Day, and `#3` Developer Tool of the Week.

**This post details the launch plan step by step.**

We started by working on the required inputs:

- **Product name**: 40 characters max
- **Product tagline**: 60 characters max
- **Description**: 260 characters max
- **Thumbnail**: recommended size = 240*240px, maximum size = 2MB
- **Image gallery**: optimized size = 1200*630px
- **Launch tags**: up to 3 tags — [see the full list here](https://www.producthunt.com/topics)

Above all, we _really_ polished the product tagline — [the most important part of a launch?](https://x.com/rajivayyangar/status/1791125203860521329) — brainstorming multiple options, balancing simplicity and accuracy.

We opted out for this option:

```
AI assistant for 100k to multi-million line codebases
```

We decided to launch on a Thursday to maximize exposure. Launch day started at 12:01 AM PST / 08:01 AM UTC by default.

For the first four hours of the day, Product Hunt hides upvotes and sorts the homepage randomly. This should help products get a chance to catch your interest — source: [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/stories/let-s-talk-about-spam)

**This launch was an opportunity to get early feedback.** We upvoted and replied to every comment on Product Hunt.

**This launch was the opportunity to raise awareness, too.** We posted it on socials (LinkedIn, X) and targeted communities, experimenting with different formats — shoutouts, behind-the-scenes, and memes.

**Pro tip**: We used open-source link management platform [Dub.co](https://refer.dub.co/fmerian) to create a short, memorable URL and help us understand the audience and most-performing channels — get 20% off for 3 months using [this link](https://refer.dub.co/fmerian)

**The results in a nutshell**

- 424 points
- 54 comments
- `#3` Product of the Day
- `#3` Developer Tool of the Week

What's next? Launching on Product Hunt is definitely not a one-time opportunity.

Awesome developer-first products like Supabase and Raycast have launched there multiple times. Launch, and keep launching. Product Hunt is about consistency, it pays off in the long term.

**Over to you! What are your key learnings from your previous launches? What worked, what didn't work?**
