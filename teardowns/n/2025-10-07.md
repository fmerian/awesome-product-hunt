## Supporting open-source products during Hacktoberfest 

We're in October, it's Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-source projects, their maintainers, and the entire community of contributors. Let's celebrate by supporting them.

I started listing open-source products launching this month. Any launches that I missed? Drop a link to your product launch in the comments, and I'll add it to the list.
