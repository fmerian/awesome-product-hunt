Meow world, welcome back to The Breakpoint, a weekly thread on all things dev tools on Product Hunt.

## The latest

> Recent dev-first products launched on the site

- Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.6, their "most advanced model" for agentic tasks
- OpenAI launched the Codex app and GPT-5.3 Codex
- v0 now supports git workflows, with built-in security features and advanced integrations
- GitBoard is an elegant macOS menu bar app for GitHub Projects
- Axel is another macOS app, an open-source task manager for running multiple coding agents

## Zoom in. Zoom out.

This week, Derek shared an interesting lesson regarding the right zoom level when building an AI product. Derek highlighted the example of Codex being too "zoomed out" from the work compared to Claude, while in contrast, Cursor and IDEs could feel too zoomed in when the vast majority of code is written by agents.

From my perspective, this might lead to a broader question: Terminal or editor-first - What’s your preferred engineering UI?
