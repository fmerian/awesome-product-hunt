## Did Anthropic win the AI coding race?

Last week, Google launched Gemini 3. This week, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5.

Did Anthropic won the AI coding race tho? Opinions are divided. While Jordan might switch to Google's latest model, Shoji and Vimal pointed out Claude's thoughtfulness code-wise. Both models definitely have pros and cons. What's for sure: it's just the beginning, and it's awesome.
