Meow world, welcome back to The Breakpoint, a weekly thread on all things dev tools on Product Hunt.

## The latest

> Recent dev-first products launched on the site

- Layercode CLI helps you quickly build, test, and deploy voice AI agents straight from your terminal
- Netlify responded to @v0 by Vercel by integrating agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini into your dashboard
- Rately helps you set custom rate limits by IP, user ID, API key, or any parameter, i.e. rate limiting as a service
- QA.tech launched a swarm of QA agents that explore your product like real users
- TimeFly Dev is an elegant coding activity tracker that lives in your IDE

## How do you use coding agents in prod? 

There's definitely no AI model that rules 'em all. @dctanner recently shared their lessons learned and best practices mixing both Claude Code and Codex in a production environment. It's definitely inspiring.

TL,DR:

As of GPT5, Codex is succeeding in tasks more often than Claude.

Every task they write now has an AI Level.

You can often do 2-3 parallel AI-first tasks at a time, reviewing one whilst the other is responding.
