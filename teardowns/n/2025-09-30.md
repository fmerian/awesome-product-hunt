## Best IDE in 2025? 

In the 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, VS Code ranked as the most-used developer environment. I was curious to know the feeling of the community.

VS Code, Cursor, and JetBrains were among the most upvoted products, with mentions of Neovim, Windsurf, Xcode, and Zed. Different programming languages, different preferences.
