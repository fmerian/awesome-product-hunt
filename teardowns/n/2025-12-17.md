## Best AI automation tools in 2025?

ICYMI @aaronoleary and the Product Hunt team are currently looking for this year's best AI automation tools. I'd nominate:

- Raycast - The app launcher is among the most followed products on Product Hunt with 19K followers; launched 3 times this year, introducing Raycast for iOS and Windows - both ranked #1 Product of the Day.
- Trigger.dev - The YC-backed, OSS company keeps the momentum going: 13K GitHub Stars, launched twice on Product Hunt over the last 12 months, and just announced a $16M Series A.
- Graphite - The AI code review companion launched twice this year and recently got acquired by Cursor.
- Ultracite - The opinionated linter and code formatter, free and open-source, trusted by companies like Vercel, Clerk, and ElevenLabs, launched twice in 6 months, and reached 2.5k GitHub Stars.
- Dimension - After months in stealth mode, the proactive AI assistant for engineering teams went GA, ranked #2 Product of the Day and #3 Developer Tool of the Week.
