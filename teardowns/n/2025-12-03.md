Meow world, welcome back to The Breakpoint, a weekly thread on all things dev tools on Product Hunt.

## The latest

> Recent dev-first products launched on the site

- Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5, their best model for coding, agents, and computer use

## Claude workflows that work

We talked about Anthropic last week, so I enjoyed reading how Viktor optimizes their workflow with Claude.

TL,DR:

1. Break tasks into small, manageable chunks
2. Always test after each change to catch silent errors
3. Be explicit
4. Maintain rigorous version control, be prepared to revert changes
5. Always verify and challenge suggested modifications
6. Last but not least? Be patient
