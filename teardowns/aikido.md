Aikido launched on Product Hunt [last month](https://www.producthunt.com/products/aikido-2/launches/aikido-security), and they _crushed it:_ 
- `#1` Product of the Day
- `#1` Developer Tool of the Month

**Full disclosure**: If this was Aikido's first launch on Product Hunt, the team does have previous launch experiences. In fact, they launched [Opengrep](https://www.producthunt.com/products/opengrep) last February and ranked `#5` Product of the Day.

## What Aikido did right

1. **Nailed the tagline.** The most important part of a launch? These 60 characters are the first thing you read on the front page. "Secure everything you build, host, and run." Simple, relatable, straight-to-the-point. 

2. **Polished the visual assets.** Underrated: The image gallery. It tells your story, visually. It starts with an intro, i.e. the OG image. IMHO It should finish with an end, i.e. your call-to-action. Nailed it.

3. **Engaged with the community.** They added a first, short comment to get the discussion started. They also upvoted and replied to every comment.

## How to apply this to your launch

- **Keep the tagline simple and relatable**
- **Show the product in your image gallery**
- **Engage with the community thoughtfully**

**Over to you! What are your key learnings from your previous product launches? What worked, what didn't work from your perspective?**
