Dimension is a proactive AI assistant for engineering teams that removes context-switching.

It launched on Product Hunt [this month](https://www.producthunt.com/products/dimension-2/launches/dimension-3), for the first time after months in stealth mode, got featured, ranked #2 Product of the Day, and #3 Developer Tool of the Week.

**Here's what they did right and how to apply it to your launch.**

## What Dimension did right

1. **Rode the tailwinds.** Their founder introduced Dimension on X [the previous day](https://x.com/suptejas/status/1991161542029500788). It gained traction with 3.5+ millions impressions and the team rode those tailwinds on Product Hunt. 

2. **Crafted the visual assets.** The image gallery is the first impression of your product. It sets expectations. High-quality assets == high-quality product. **Pro tip**: The image gallery tells your story, visually. It starts with an intro, i.e. the OG image. IMHO It should finish with an end, i.e. your call-to-action. Take Dimension for example.

3. **Kept momentum going.** Last but not least, the team kept the momentum going post-launch by running a billboard ad campaign to stay top of mind.

## How to apply this to your launch

- **The right time to launch could be now**
- **Show the product in your image gallery**
- **Keep the momentum going by engaging in threads and running ads**

**Over to you! What are your key learnings from your previous product launches? What worked, what didn't work from your perspective?**
