When you start prepping a launch on Product Hunt, you may read here and there stories, how-tos, step-by-step guides, and playbooks. This is another, different story.

I had the opportunity to work with the team at Kilo Code [^1] on their launch. We ranked `#1` Product of the Day and `#1` OSS Product of the Week although we didn't apply most of the pro tips you may read on the Internet.

## TL,DR

* You don't need a 4-week plan
* You don't need to launch on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday
* You don't need to cold outreach people

## How not to launch on Product Hunt (and reach `#1` Product of the Day)

### You don't need a 4-week plan

The focus at Kilo Code is on speed. [^2] We started working on the topic 5 days before the launch. 5 days. We posted a thread in `/p/kilocode` [^3] and hosted a X Space. [^4]

### You don't need to launch on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday

According to hunted.space, [^5] Product Hunt has the highest traffic/visibility on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. 

We launched Kilo Code on a Sunday. Why? Because of the target audience. Kilo Code is targeting developers, and many of them are developers in and out of work, with hobby projects to experiment with a new language, framework, or tool. 

### You don't need to cold outreach people

We didn't send any direct messages. We did post and repost on existing channels:

* Discord: 8,146 members
* Twitter/X: 6,578 followers
* LinkedIn: 1,095 followers 

## Wrapping up

When launching Kilo Code on Product Hunt, we didn't check the lists you may find here and there. We didn't plan 4 weeks in advance. We didn't launch on a weekday or send direct messages. We kept it simple.

**Results?**

* 610 upvotes
* 216 comments
* `#1` Product of the Day
* `#7` Product of the Week
* `#1` OSS Product of the Week
* `#1` OSS Product of the Month

You may wonder what my main lesson learned from this launch is. Here's the secret:

**Keep it simple, and enjoy your launch day.**
